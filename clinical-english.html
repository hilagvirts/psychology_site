                        <h2>Program Overview</h2>
                        <p>
                            The Clinical Psychology program at Ariel University offers comprehensive professional training for working therapeutically 
                            with diverse populations following the practitioner-researcher model. Our two-year program combines rigorous academic training 
                            with extensive practical experience, preparing graduates for clinical practice and research careers. The program is taught 
                            entirely in English and provides students with advanced knowledge in psychopathology, assessment, and evidence-based treatment 
                            approaches.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Students in the clinical program develop both as scientists and practitioners, learning to integrate research findings into 
                            clinical work while maintaining the highest professional and ethical standards. The curriculum emphasizes critical thinking, 
                            cultural competence, and the development of strong therapeutic skills across various theoretical orientations.
                        </p>

                    <section class="text-section" id="structure">
                        <h2>Program Structure and Duration</h2>
                        <p>
                            The program extends over two years (four semesters) and is conducted entirely in English. Students complete 16 required courses 
                            covering core clinical competencies, along with 5 elective courses allowing for specialization in areas of particular interest. 
                            The program follows a practitioner-researcher model, emphasizing both clinical skills and research capabilities.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A distinctive feature of our program is the extensive 24-month practicum requirement, during which students engage in supervised 
                            clinical work twice weekly at approved training sites. This extended practical training, beginning in the second semester of 
                            the first year, ensures that graduates are well-prepared for independent clinical practice and meet all requirements for 
                            professional licensure.

                        <h2>Admission Requirements</h2>
                        <p>
                            Admission to the clinical psychology program is highly competitive. Applicants must hold a Bachelor's degree in Psychology 
                            from a recognized university with a minimum grade point average of 85 or equivalent. Standardized test scores are required: 
                            either a GRE score of 300 or above, or a Meitam score of 100 or higher. Advanced English proficiency is essential, as all 
                            instruction and clinical supervision are conducted in English.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In addition to academic credentials, applicants must successfully complete a personal interview with the admissions committee. 
                            The interview assesses clinical aptitude, interpersonal skills, motivation for clinical work, and fit with the program's 
                            training philosophy. Application deadlines and specific submission requirements are available on the department website.

                        <p>
                            The program is designed to serve two primary student populations. First, English-speaking immigrants (Olim) seeking clinical 
                            training in Israel find this program particularly suitable, as it provides professional education in their native language 
                            while preparing them for practice in the Israeli mental health system. Second, native Israeli students with excellent English 
                            proficiency who wish to enhance their international professional opportunities benefit from the program's English-language 
                            curriculum and global perspective.

                    <section class="text-section" id="curriculum">
                        <h2>Curriculum</h2>
                        <p>
                            The curriculum is organized into required courses and electives, providing both breadth and depth in clinical training. 
                            Required courses cover essential topics including advanced psychopathology, clinical assessment and diagnosis, psychodynamic 
                            theory and practice, cognitive-behavioral therapy, evidence-based treatments, crisis intervention, group therapy, and family 
                            therapy. Additional required courses address professional development, research methodology, statistics, thesis seminars, 
                            professional ethics, cultural competence, neuroscience foundations, and clinical supervision.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Elective courses allow students to specialize in areas such as trauma and PTSD treatment, child and adolescent therapy, 
                            personality disorders, addiction and substance abuse, couples therapy, play therapy, psychopharmacology, neuropsychological 
                            assessment, mindfulness-based interventions, and geriatric psychology. This flexibility enables students to tailor their 
                            education to their specific career goals and clinical interests.

                        <h2>Clinical Practicum</h2>
                        <p>
                            The 24-month clinical practicum is a cornerstone of the training program. Students complete supervised clinical work twice 
                            weekly at approved placement sites, which include psychiatric hospitals and outpatient clinics, community mental health centers, 
                            rehabilitation facilities, university counseling centers, and supervised private practice settings. This extensive practical 
                            experience ensures that students develop strong clinical skills and professional confidence.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Supervision is provided through multiple channels: weekly individual supervision at the placement site by licensed clinical 
                            psychologists, group supervision sessions at the university, and regular case presentations allowing for peer learning and 
                            collaborative problem-solving. Clinical activities during the practicum include individual psychotherapy across various 
                            theoretical orientations, group therapy facilitation, comprehensive psychological assessment, treatment planning and documentation, 
                            and participation in interdisciplinary treatment teams.

                        <p>
                            All students complete an original research thesis under faculty supervision, demonstrating their capacity for independent 
                            scientific inquiry. The thesis process unfolds across the two years of study. In the first year, first semester, students 
                            complete research methods coursework, conduct literature reviews, and select research topics. During the first year, second 
                            semester, they develop detailed proposals, obtain IRB approval, and begin data collection.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The second year focuses on completing data collection, conducting statistical analyses, writing the thesis, and preparing 
                            for the final defense. Faculty advisors provide ongoing guidance throughout this process, and students present their work 
                            in research seminars, receiving feedback from peers and faculty. The completed thesis serves as preparation for those 
                            students who wish to continue to doctoral studies.
